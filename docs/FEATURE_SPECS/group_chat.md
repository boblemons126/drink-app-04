# Feature Specification: Group Chat

## Overview
The Group Chat feature enables real-time communication between members of a group or session, allowing users to coordinate plans, share updates, and enhance social connection during nights out. This feature is essential for the mobile-first experience, enabling users to stay connected with their group without leaving the DRNKUP app.

## User Stories
- As a group member, I want to send messages to my entire group, so that I can communicate plans and updates without leaving the app.
- As a session participant, I want to chat with others attending the same session, so that we can coordinate in real-time during the night out.
- As a user, I want to receive notifications for new messages, so that I don't miss important updates from my group.
- As a group admin, I want to pin important messages, so that critical information remains visible to all members.

## Requirements

2. User selects a specific group/session
3. User taps on "Chat" button to enter the chat interface
4. User can view message history and compose new messages
5. New messages appear in real-time for all participants
6. Notifications alert users to new messages when app is in background

### Wireframes/Mockups
[To be created by design team - will include mobile-optimized chat interface with emphasis on one-handed operation]

## Technical Implementation

### Components
- `ChatList`: Component displaying all active chats
- `ChatDetail`: Main chat interface with message list and input
- `MessageBubble`: Individual message display with sender info and timestamp
- `ChatInput`: Text input with emoji picker and attachment options
- `MediaPicker`: Component for selecting and previewing media to share

### Data Models
```typescript
interface ChatMessage {
  id: string;
  group_id: string;
  session_id?: string;
  sender_id: string;
  content: string;
  content_type: 'text' | 'image' | 'location';
  media_url?: string;
  location_data?: {
    latitude: number;
    longitude: number;
    venue_name?: string;
  };
  created_at: string;
  updated_at?: string;
  is_pinned: boolean;
  reactions: {
    [reaction_type: string]: string[]; // Array of user IDs
  };
  read_by: string[]; // Array of user IDs
}

interface ChatMetadata {
  group_id: string;
  session_id?: string;
  last_message_preview: string;
  last_message_time: string;
  unread_count: number;
  is_muted: boolean;
  participants: {
    user_id: string;
    last_read_at: string;
    is_typing: boolean;
  }[];
}
```

### API Endpoints
- `GET /api/chats/:group_id`: Retrieve chat history for a group
- `POST /api/chats/:group_id/messages`: Send a new message
- `PUT /api/chats/:group_id/messages/:message_id`: Update a message (e.g., pin/unpin)
- `POST /api/chats/:group_id/messages/:message_id/reactions`: Add a reaction to a message
- `DELETE /api/chats/:group_id/messages/:message_id/reactions/:reaction_type`: Remove a reaction

### State Management
- Real-time message state managed through Supabase subscriptions
- Local message cache for offline access and faster loading
- Optimistic UI updates for message sending with background synchronization
- Redux/Context for managing active chats and unread counts

## Dependencies
- Supabase Realtime for WebSocket connections and subscriptions
- React Native Image Picker (or web equivalent) for media selection
- Emoji Mart for emoji selection interface
- React Query for data fetching and cache management

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for message rendering and formatting
- Integration tests for message sending and receiving flows
- End-to-end tests for complete chat experience
- Performance testing for high-volume message scenarios
- Offline capability testing

## Implementation Plan
1. Set up database schema for messages and chat metadata (2 days)
2. Implement basic chat UI components (3 days)
3. Integrate Supabase Realtime for message subscriptions (2 days)
4. Add media sharing capabilities (2 days)
5. Implement notifications system (2 days)
6. Add advanced features (reactions, pinning, etc.) (3 days)
7. Testing and refinement (3 days)

## Rollout Strategy
- Initial beta release to select test groups
- Monitor performance metrics and user feedback
- Phased rollout to all users after stability confirmed
- Feature announcement via in-app notification

## Future Enhancements
- Voice message support
- Group video chat for virtual pre-gaming
- Message search functionality
- Rich message formatting (markdown, etc.)
- Scheduled messages for event reminders

## Questions & Considerations
- How to handle very large groups (performance implications)?
- Privacy considerations for location sharing
- Message retention policy and storage implications
- Moderation tools for inappropriate content
